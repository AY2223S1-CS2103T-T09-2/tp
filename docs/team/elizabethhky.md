### Project: PetCode

PetCode is a software app that aims to facilitate better working experience and boost business management efficiency 
for pet sale coordinators. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written 
in Java, and has about 30 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
